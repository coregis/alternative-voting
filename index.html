	<p class="moreinfo">This map tracks the use of three alternative voting systems in the United States: cumulative, limited, and ranked-choice voting. Over 200 places in the United States currently use one of these systems for the election of local offices. Another 100 have used one of these systems in the past, or have passed legislation to do so, but have yet to implement it. As the map shows, alternative voting systems have long been part of democracy in the United States and have been used in 30 of the 50 states. 
	
	<br><br>
	
	We’ve split the voting systems into two categories based on the number of winners they elect. Single-winner systems, such as instant runoff and Bucklin voting, both forms of ranked-choice voting, appear in shades of red. Blue shaded markers indicate multi-winner systems, including cumulative, and limited voting, plus single-transferable vote (a multi-winner ranked system). The brightness of the map markers indicates the status of the system, with dark hues representing systems currently in use, and lighter hues indicating historical uses or those not yet implemented. Finally two small icons indicate the jurisdiction level: markers with a star indicate systems for electing state-level officials; markers with the book icon indicate systems for electing school board members. Markers without these icons indicate places where these voting systems were used to elect city or county officers.

	Though we’ve done our best to make this map as accurate as possible, we know we’ve missed a few spots. If you know of a place that has used one of these voting system and isn’t on this map, please drop us a line and let us know.
